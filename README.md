# ipmiutil-wrapper

## About

- _[ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/)_ is a useful IPMI command line tool, but it is very weak as a library
- __ipmiutil-wrapper__ is a wrapper for _[ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/)_,  which aims to provide more program-friendly c++ style interfaces

## Status


- Currently __ipmiutil-wrapper__ only implements interfaces needed for my own project
- Please feel free to fork and pull requests to make this library more useful
